# Iris Flower Data Analysis
In this project, we will be analysing iris flower data set to classify different species into their respective classes. The iris flower dataset consists of 150 entries from 3 different species, 50 samples from each specie. The species are setosa, versicolor and virginica. There are four numerical feature columns and one column which contains categorical variable or targets.

## How to get the dataset?
Either download from kaggle website or UCI Machine Learning repository onto your local machine or import dataset provided by sklearn. 

## Project Directory 
The project directory consists of following jupyter notebook files:
* EDA_and_Statistical_Testing 
* Machine_Learning_Classifiers

1. EDA_and_Statistical_Testing
* In EDA and Statistical Testing, we will be first exploring the dataset with the help of visualization tools such as Matplotlib and seaborn library. Before EDA, we need to make   sure that our data must be clean an dit should not have outliers and anomalies. After getting familiar with the data, an exploratory data analysis was done using pairplots and density plot of the different features and species.
